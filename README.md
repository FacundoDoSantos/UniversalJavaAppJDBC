## Data Base Visualization App
Tested under MySQL
Version: 5.5.5-10.4.20-MariaDB
Driver Name: MySQL Connector/J
Version: mysql-connector-java-8.0.25 (Revision: 08be9e9b4cba6aa115f9b27b215887af40b159e0)

To work, this app requires an "config-data.txt" file with 4 lines.

In firs line you need to specified the driver name to connect with the Data Base. Example "jdbc:mysql://localhost/db_name"

Second line is for user name and third line for password. In my case i was using "root" and "".

Fourt line is for data base name.

Like this:

 - jdbc:mysql://localhost/db_name
 - root
- 
- db_name
